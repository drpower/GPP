States without such laws may require us to send you and the State notification of your purchases at year end, as well as remind you of the obligation to pay any sales tax due with your personal income tax return. Sales tax exemptions can only be requested by submission of a valid sales tax exemption certificate issued by your State tax department in advance to Generac Power Products, 800 Hinesburg Road, VT 05403.
