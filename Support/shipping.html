        <p><strong>Please note:</strong> All shipping charges are for deliveries within the contiguous 48 United States. Additional shipping charges may apply to orders shipped outside the contiguous 48 United States. For online orders, the shipping charge for deliveries outside the contiguous U.S. and for foreign deliveries will be calculated once your order is received. Your order confirmation will not reflect these amounts. Once your order has been processed, we will contact you with the exact shipping charge. Any applicable government taxes or customs fees for foreign deliveries will be charged separately by the shipper upon delivery.</p>
        <p>All prices are in U.S. funds and are subject to change without notice.</p>

      <h2>Motor Freight Delivery Methods</h2>

      <h3>Depot Delivery</h3>
      <p>We ship to hundreds of trucking depots across the U.S. When we receive your order, we will determine the trucking depot closest to you. Most will load your machine into your vehicle (you'll need to have a pickup truck or trailer).</p>
      <h3>Business Delivery</h3>
      <p>Choose a business in your area to have your machine delivered to. The business you select must have a loading and off-loading facility and must accept delivery during normal business hours (without advance notification). Typical businesses used by our customers include feed stores, lumber yards, building supply centers, etc.</p>
      <h3>Home Delivery</h3>
      <p>Your home and driveway must be accessible to a tractor-trailer, and someone must be home to accept delivery. Because the driver is not required to unload your machine, you should plan on having a couple of sturdy 10-foot planks (2&quot; thick x 10&quot; wide, minimum) and at least one or two helpers to help remove the machine from the truck.</p>
      <h3>Enhanced Home Delivery</h3>
      <p>Our most comprehensive option. Your machine will be removed from the truck by the driver and placed on the ground. Someone must be available to accept delivery, and your home and driveway must be accessible to a tractor-trailer.</p>
